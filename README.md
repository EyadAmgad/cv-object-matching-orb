# Object Matching using ORB (OpenCV)

This project demonstrates how to locate a query object in a larger target image using ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) and BFMatcher from OpenCV.

##  Features
- Feature extraction using ORB
- Feature matching with BFMatcher
- Match visualization with Matplotlib


## üñºÔ∏è Example
Given:
- `queryFoot.png`: an image with a football
- `targetFoot.png`: an image where the football exists

The script locates the object by matching keypoints.


### Requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
